    A steak, also sometimes called "beef steak", is a meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, potentially including a bone. It is normally grilled, though it can also be pan-fried. Steak can also be cooked in sauce, such as in steak and kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Thick cut steak</li>

        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring steak to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Pat dry and season the steak generously with salt and pepper - this helps form that amazing crust we all know and love about great steaks.</li>
        <li>Get your skillet SMOKING HOT before putting the steak in - again, for the crust</li>
        <li>Wait 2.5 minutes and then flip the steak</li>
        <li>After another minute add the butter, thyme and garlic.</li>
        <li>Lower to medium heat and baste the steak with the melted butter.</li>
        <li>When the steak reaches internal temperature of 52 degrees take off skillet.</li>
        <li>Allow steak to rest for 5-10 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy with family and friends!</li>
    </ol>
